Student Performance Analysis – Insights from Kaggle Dataset

This project explores student exam performance in relation to various socio-demographic factors, using the Kaggle dataset: Student Performance in Exams.

Key Insights:

Parental education level showed the strongest correlation with student success — students whose parents had higher education were significantly more likely to pass all exams.

Reading and writing scores had a very high correlation (~95%), while math scores were moderately correlated (~85%) — indicating math performance may rely on additional factors.

Students from certain race/ethnic groups consistently outperformed others, suggesting potential disparities worth deeper investigation.

Interestingly, students who completed the test preparation course had lower pass rates, contrary to expectations — this may indicate selection bias (i.e. struggling students may be more likely to enroll).

Female students outperformed males overall in passing rates, especially in reading and writing, while males scored slightly higher in math.

The free/reduced lunch variable (not deeply explored here) showed that students who did not receive school-provided meals performed better — possibly tied to underlying socioeconomic conditions.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data cleansing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis

Data visualization

Summary:

This project showcases how educational performance can be influenced by a variety of social and demographic factors — with parental education standing out as a key predictor. It also demonstrates skills in data cleaning, statistical insight generation, and effective visualization — essential for roles in data analysis, research, and data-driven decision-making.
